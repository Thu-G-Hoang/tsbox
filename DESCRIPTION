Description: A toolbox to deal with time series. Built around a set of
  converters, which reliably convert time series stored as "ts", "xts",
  "data.frame" or "data.table" to each other. Because this works, we can define
  a set of tools that work the same way for each class. And, we can write a plot
  function that just works.
